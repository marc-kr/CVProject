# Football Longshot Ball Tracking with RT-DETR

  This project implements a deep learning-based tracking system to detect and track the football ball in longshot video footage of matches.

  We fine-tuned a transformer-based object detection model (RT-DETR), applied it to annotated football match videos, and enhanced its performance through tracking (BYTETrack) and post-processing techniques for accurate, temporally-consistent ball tracking.

# Dataset & Annotations
  * Training videos: 4 annotated longshot match recordings.

  * Testing videos: 2 unseen annotated match recordings.

  * Annotations: bounding boxes identifying the ball in each frame.

# Data Augmentation
To increase generalization, we applied the following transformations:

*  Translation

*  Scaling

*  Shear

*  Brightness Variation

*  Hue Variation

*  Horizontal Flip

# Tracking System
To produce smooth, consistent tracking of the ball across frames, we implemented:

1. BYTETrack
  * A robust multi-object tracking method that:

  * Associates detections across time.

  * Handles short-term occlusions and detection gaps.

2. Custom Post-Processing Algorithm
A lightweight algorithm to improve tracking stability:

  *  False Positive Filtering
Removes tracks with very low spatial variance, which likely correspond to noise or false detections.

   Track Smoothing & Gap Filling
Applies a simple uniform motion model to:

Interpolate missing frames.

Make ball motion appear continuous and realistic.

  * Track ID Assignment & Merging

Reduces ID switching by comparing and merging similar tracks.

Assigns stable IDs based on motion coherence.
